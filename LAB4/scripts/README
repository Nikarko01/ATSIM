This folder contains a set of utilities that will help you in the exercises of Molecular Dynamics.
The Gulp program will generate a file "itsname.trg" that contains the configurations generated at different times by the MD simulation. There is a lot of information that can be extracted out of it, so to speed up your work, you'll find in this directory a set of scripts.

First use parser.py to parse the .trg file in a way more convenient to python.
To execute a script written in python, type the following on the command line.
> python parser.py itsname.trg itsname.gout values.json
It will produce a "values.json" file (its name being the last input to command line).
Moreover, it will produce a file called E_of_t.dat, that contains the values of time, temperature and energies as a function of time.

Then you can use the other scripts to compute physical quantities

msd.py is used to compute the MSD of a run
> python msd.py values.json
Receives in input the name of the json file produced by the parser.py script.
Produces a msd.dat file with the values of t, MSD(t) and d/dt MSD(t).

rdf.py computes the radial distribution function (rdf). Execute it as
> python rdf.py values.json
The scripts computes the rdf dividing the radial distance in bins. 

vaf.py computes the velocity autocorrelation function (vaf). 
> python vaf.py values.json
Returns a file vaf.dat with vaf as a function of t


Keep in mind that options can be viewed with:
> python myscript.py -h
or
> python myscript.py --help
