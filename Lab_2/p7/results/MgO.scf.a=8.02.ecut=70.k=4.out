     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =    -130.03234377 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      62.23726475 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -23.61178027 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -60.11281467 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  56 iterations
