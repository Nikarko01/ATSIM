     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =    -124.71447885 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      59.97350779 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -23.64902063 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -63.18542249 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  56 iterations
